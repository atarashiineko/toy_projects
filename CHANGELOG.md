## 2025-06-09 Added project URL to README

**Task Overview**
Added a link to the hosted project in the README.

**Context**
The README did not include a direct URL to the live site, making it harder for users to find.

**Thought Process**
Decided to place the URL in a dedicated section near the top so visitors can quickly access the deployed site.

**Chosen Solution**
Added a "Project URL" section to the README pointing to the GitHub Pages deployment.

**Implementation**
- Updated `README.md` with the new section.
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` documenting this change.

**Verification**
Reviewed the README to confirm the link is present and correctly formatted.

**Deployment**
No deployment steps are necessary; this is documentation only.

**Impact Summary**
Users now have immediate access to the live project via the README link.
