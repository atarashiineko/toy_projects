## 2025-06-09 Enable automatic sidebar generation

**Task Overview**
Configured Docusaurus to automatically include new markdown files in the sidebar.

**Context**
Sidebars were manually updated whenever a new document was added, which was error prone.

**Thought Process**
Leveraged Docusaurus's builtin autogeneration feature to eliminate manual steps.

**Chosen Solution**
Switch the sidebar definition to use `autogenerated` so every file in `docs/` is listed automatically.

**Implementation**
- Modified `sidebars.ts` to use the autogenerated configuration.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with this entry.

**Verification**
Ran `npm run typecheck` to ensure configuration compiles.

**Deployment**
Rebuild the site to generate the sidebar from the filesystem.

**Impact Summary**
Documentation maintenance is simpler since new files appear in the sidebar automatically.
## 2025-06-09 Added thermal printer pixel art prompt

**Task Overview**
Created a new prompt for generating pixelated images in thermal printer style.

**Context**
The prompt collection lacked guidance on producing black-and-white pixel art images.

**Thought Process**
Followed repository conventions to place the prompt under a new visual category.

**Chosen Solution**
Added a markdown file containing detailed instructions for creating the effect.

**Implementation**
- Created `docs/visual.pixel-art/2025-06-09_thermal-printer-pixel.v000.md`.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with this entry.

**Verification**
Checked the file to ensure formatting and front matter are correct.

**Deployment**
No deployment steps are required for this documentation update.

**Impact Summary**
Expands the repository's prompt library with a new pixel-art style guide.
## 2025-06-09 Added project URL to README

**Task Overview**
Added a link to the hosted project in the README.

**Context**
The README did not include a direct URL to the live site, making it harder for users to find.

**Thought Process**
Decided to place the URL in a dedicated section near the top so visitors can quickly access the deployed site.

**Chosen Solution**
Added a "Project URL" section to the README pointing to the GitHub Pages deployment.

**Implementation**
- Updated `README.md` with the new section.
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` documenting this change.

**Verification**
Reviewed the README to confirm the link is present and correctly formatted.

**Deployment**
No deployment steps are necessary; this is documentation only.

**Impact Summary**
Users now have immediate access to the live project via the README link.
