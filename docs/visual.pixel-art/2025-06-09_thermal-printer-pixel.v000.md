## Prompt
Create image. Generate a pixelated, black-and-white rendition of the subject in this photo as if printed on a thermal printer. Represent all details using square pixels arranged on a uniform grid, with each pixel rendered as pure black or pure white only.
Translate contours into blocky, stair-step edges by approximating curves with pixel clusters five to seven pixels wide, ensuring consistent pixel dimensions throughout.
Exaggerate proportions so the head occupies forty to fifty percent of the total figure height, with torso and limbs occupying the remaining half; depict these regions as contiguous pixel masses without intermediate shades.
Render the neck as a short, two-pixel-wide column connecting broad, slightly tapered shoulders to the oversized head.
Form arms and legs as thick, rectangular pixel columns four to six pixels across, omitting joint articulation except as implied by abrupt pixel angle changes.
Depict hands with four mitten-like pixel shapes each occupying a four-by-four pixel area; define fingers as smooth blocks of pixels without individual knuckle detail.
In the face, place large circular eyes approximated by eight to ten black pixels forming a near-circle whose diameter is one-quarter of the head height; insert a single central white pixel for the pupil highlight.
Render eyebrows as pixel blocks two to three pixels high following the brow arc, tilting them slightly upward toward the outer edges by shifting pixel positions diagonally.
Design the nose as a single two-pixel-wide, three-pixel-high cluster centered just below the eye line, shaped like a rounded block without nostril indication.
Depict the mouth as a curved row of black pixels in the lower third of the face, extending six to eight pixels wide with upturned ends to create a joyful, friendly expression.
Indicate cheeks by adding two three-pixel clusters of black pixels on either side of the face below the eye line to suggest blush spots; these clusters should be spaced at least five pixels from the mouth to avoid overlap.
If facial hair appears, represent it as a contiguous black pixel block broken into a few rounded clusters with a scalloped bottom edge by selectively removing pixels to create curves.
Render hair or facial hair in solid black pixel masses divided into large, rounded tufts; form the top-of-head hairline as a series of pixel peaks two to three pixels high.
For clothing and accessories, use solid black pixel regions outlined by a one-pixel-thick border of white to distinguish edges; select one region per garment without introducing shading.
Suggest folds or creases by omitting pixels to create narrow white lines one pixel wide; place these lines at logical angles beneath shoulders or between limbs and torso.
Render shadows only as blocks of black pixels directly beneath the chin, brow, and garment foldsâ€”no dithered or grayed patterns.
Design decorative elements such as emblems, belts, or handles using simple geometric pixel shapes (squares, rectangles, straight lines) with each shape at least three pixels wide.
If a repeating pattern is needed, draw it with thin lines of white pixels within a black field, keeping all pattern lines uniform in width and separated by at least two pixels.
Set the background to solid white with no additional textures or gradients.
Ensure the final result is distinctly low-resolution, bold, and blocky, with pure black and white pixels forming simple, pixel-art forms that evoke a thermal-printer aesthetic.

## Parameters
- `subject_photo`: image or description of the subject to transform

## Usage Example
**Input**
User: "Generate a thermal printer pixel drawing of a friendly dog."

**Expected Output**
A blocky black-and-white pixel art dog with a large head occupying half the height, thick rectangular limbs, and simplified facial features.

## Notes
This prompt is designed for visual transformation tasks. It exaggerates features for a stylized, coarse pixel aesthetic and uses only solid black and white.
